    <h2>The History</h2>


    <p>
        In cuisine, an omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a
        frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg). It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around
        fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination of
        the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water. </p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black or white pepper</li>
        <li>2 ounces (55g) grated cheddar, pepper Jack, or Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>Half of one large green, red, or yellow bell pepper (4 oz; 110g), stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch
            dice</li>
        <li>One quarter of one medium yellow onion (2 oz; 55g), cut into 1/2-inch dice
        </li>
        <li>Pinch smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 1/2 ounces (70g) ham (about 3 slices), cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>





    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, season eggs with salt and pepper, then whisk until homogeneous and frothy. Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add cheese to a medium heatproof mixing bowl. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon
            butter over medium-high heat, swirling, until lightly browned. Add bell pepper and onion, season with salt,
            and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Add ham and cook,
            stirring occasionally, until vegetables and ham are browned in spots and smell pleasantly smoky, about 5
            minutes longer. Stir in smoked paprika and freshly ground black pepper. Scrape vegetables and ham into the
            cheese and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Wipe out skillet and set over medium heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter and cook until melted and
            lightly browned. Re-whisk eggs until foamy, then add to skillet and cook, using a silicone spatula to push
            the edges in toward the center as they set and tilting the pan to spread the uncooked egg underneath.
            Continue pushing in the edges of the eggs and tilting the skillet, working all around the pan, until
            omelette is almost set, about 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle ham, vegetables, and cheese over half of omelette, remove from heat, cover, and let omelette sit
            until mostly or fully cooked through on top (depending on your preferred consistency), about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Using silicone spatula, loosen the edges of the omelette from skillet and shake skillet to ensure that it's
            not stuck. Carefully fold omelette in half to enclose the filling, then slide it onto a serving plate and
            serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Devour</li>
    </ol>
