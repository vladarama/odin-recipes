    <h2>The Recipe</h2>


    <p>
        Pizza (Italian: pittsa], Neapolitan: [pittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
        base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
        various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
        baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
        pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. </p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>





    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour,
            1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning
            once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook
            beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce,
            oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Devour</li>
    </ol>
